LaTeX reading notes

All of the PDF files are automatically built and can be found by [clicking here](https://nightly.link/hinsley/reading-notes/workflows/build-latex-docs/main/PDFs.zip).

# Contributing
This is primarily for me as a reminder in case I step away for a while: When adding a new folder for `.tex` files, make sure to update *both* "Compile LaTeX documents" and "Upload PDFs" tasks in `.github/workflows/build-latex-docs.yml`.

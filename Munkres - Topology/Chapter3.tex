\section{Local Compactness}

\textbf{Definition.} A space $X$ is \emph{locally compact at $x$} if there is some compact subspace $C$ of $X$ that contains a nbhd of $x$. If $X$ is locally compact at each of its points, $X$ is said to be \emph{locally compact}.

We ask: "Under what conditions is a space homeomorphic with a subspace of a compact Hausdorff space?"

\textbf{Theorem 29.1.} Let $X$ be a space. $X$ is locally compact Hausdorff iff there exists a space $Y$ satisfying the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $X$ is a subspace of $Y$.
    \item $Y - X$ comprises a single point.
    \item $Y$ is a compact Hausdorff space.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Definition.} If $Y$ is a compact Hausdorff space and $X$ is a proper subspace of $Y$ dense in $Y$, then $Y$ is said to be a \emph{compactification} of $X$. If $Y - X$ equals a single point, then $Y$ is called the \emph{one-point compactification} of $X$.

\textbf{Theorem 29.2.} Let $X$ be a Hausdorff space. Then $X$ is locally compact iff given $x \in X$ and a nbhd $U$ of $x$, there is a nbhd $V$ of $x$ such that $\overline{V}$ is compact and $\overline{V} \subset U$.

\textbf{Corollary 29.3.} Any open or closed subspace of a locally compact Hausdorff space is itself locally compact.

\textbf{Corollary 29.4.} A space $X$ is homeomorphic to an open subspace of a compact Hausdorff space iff $X$ is locally compact Hausdorff.

\section*{Exercises}

(1) Show that the rationals $\Q$ are not locally compact.

\textbf{Proof.} It will be sufficient to show that $\Q$ is not locally compact at $0$; i.e., that there is no compact subspace of $\Q$ containing a neighborhood of $0$.

Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there existed a compact subspace $C$ of $\Q$ and an open nbhd $U$ of $0$ in $C$. Then there would be some open nbhd $(-\varepsilon, \varepsilon) \cap \Q \subseteq U$ of $0$. Note that the inclusion $\Q \overset{\iota}{\hookrightarrow} \R$ is continuous; this map preserves compactness. Hence $\iota(C)$ is compact in $\R$. As $\R$ is Hausdorff, $\iota(C)$ is closed in $\R$. Thus $[-\varepsilon, \varepsilon] = \overline{(-\varepsilon, \varepsilon) \cap \Q} \subseteq \iota(C)$. Since $[-\varepsilon, \varepsilon]$ is uncountable while $\iota(C)$ is countable, we obtain a contradiction. Hence $\Q$ is not locally compact. $\square$

\section*{Supplementary Exercises: Nets}

Nets are generalizations of sequences that characterize limit points, continuous functions, and compact sets not only in metric topologies, but in \emph{all} topologies.

\textbf{Definition.} A \emph{directed set} $J$ is a poset wherein for each pair $\alpha, \beta \in J$, there exists an element $\gamma \in J$ such that $\alpha \preceq \gamma$ and $\beta \preceq \gamma$.

(1) Show that the following are directed sets:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Any simply ordered set, under the relation $\leq$.
    \item The collection of all subsets of a set $S$, partially ordered by inclusion.
    \item A collection $\mathscr{A}$ of subsets of $S$ that is closed under finite intersections, partially ordered by reverse inclusion.
    \item The collection of all closed subsets of a space $X$, partially ordered by inclusion.
\end{itemize}

(2) A subset $K$ of $J$ is said to be \emph{cofinal} in $J$ if for each $\alpha \in J$, there exists $\beta \in K$ such that $\alpha \preceq \beta$. Show that if $J$ is a directed set and $K$ is cofinal in $J$, then $K$ is a directed set.

(3) Let $X$ be a topological space. A \emph{net} in $X$ is a function $f$ from a directed set $J$ into $X$. If $\alpha \in J$, we usually denote $f(\alpha)$ by $x_\alpha$. We denote the net $f$ itself by the symbol $(x_\alpha)_{\alpha \in J}$, or merely by $(x_\alpha)$ if the index set is understood.

The net $(x_\alpha)$ is said to \emph{converge} to the point $x \in X$ (written $x_\alpha \to x$) if for each nbhd $U$ of $x$, there exists $\alpha \in J$ such that $\alpha \preceq \beta \implies x_\beta \in U$ Show that these definitions reduce to familiar ones when $J = Z_+$.

(4) Suppose that $(x_\alpha)_{\alpha \in J} \to x \in X$ and $(y_\alpha)_{\alpha \in J} \to y \in Y$. Show that $(x_\alpha \times y_\alpha) \to x \times y \in X \times Y$.

(5) Show that if $X$ is Hausdorff, a net in $X$ converges to at most one point.

(6) \textbf{Theorem.} Let $A \in X$. Then $x \in \overline{A}$ iff there is a net of points of $A$ converging to $x$.

(7) \textbf{Theorem.} Let $f : X \to Y$. Then $f$ is continuous iff for every convergent net $(x_\alpha) \to x$ in $X$, the net $(f(x_\alpha))$ converges to $f(x)$.

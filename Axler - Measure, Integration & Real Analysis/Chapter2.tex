\section{Outer measure on $\R$}

We have defined the outer measure $|A|$ of a set $A \subseteq \R$ as
\[|A| = \inf\left\{\sum_{k=1}^\infty m(I_k) \mid I_1, I_2, \ldots \text{ are open intervals such that } A \subseteq \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty I_k\right\}.\]
The first novel result in this chapter states that the outer measure is not additive:

\textbf{Theorem 2.18.} There exist disjoint subsets $A, B \subset \R$ such that $|A \cup B| \neq |A| + |B|$.

\emph{Proof.} If $a \in [-1, 1]$, let $\tilde{a} = \{c \in [-1, 1] \mid a - c \in \Q\}$. We have $[-1, 1] = \bigcup_{a \in [-1, 1]} \tilde{a}$. Invoking the axiom of choice, let $V$ be a set containing a representative element of $\tilde{a}$ for each distinct $a \in [-1, 1]$. Enumerate the elements of $[-2, 2] \cap \Q$ as $\{r_1, r_2, \ldots\}$.

Axler claims that it then follows that $[-1, 1] \subset \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty (r_k + V)$. But why? This is because, for any $v \in V$, we have $\tilde{v} \subset \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty (r_k + v)$. Since $\tilde{v} = \tilde{a}$ for a unique $a \in [-1, 1]$ and each such $a \in [-1, 1]$ has a corresponding $v \in V$, this gives the desired result.

We then have by countable subadditivity, the order preservation of outer measure, and translation invariance the inequality $2 = |[-1, 1]| \leq \sum_{k=1}^\infty |r_k + V| = \sum_{k=1}^\infty |V| = \infty$. Hence $|V| > 0$.

The sets $r_1 + V, r_2 + V, \ldots$ are disjoint (recall the construction of $V$). Let $n \in \Z^+$. Then $\bigcup_{k=1}^n (r_k + V) \subset [-3, 3]$. This implies that $\left|\bigcup_{k=1}^n (r_k + V)\right| \leq 6$. Note that $\sum_{k=1}^n |r_k + V| = \sum_{k=1}^n |V| = n|V|$. By Archimedean principle we may choose $n$ so that $n|V| > 6$. It follows then that $\left|\bigcup_{k=1}^n (r_k + V)\right| < \sum_{k=1}^n |r_k + V|$. Because these $r_k + V$ are disjoint, we observe by induction that we have proven the theorem. $\square$

\section*{Exercises}

\textbf{1} Prove that if $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $\R$ and $|B| = 0$, then $|A \cup B| = |A|$.

\emph{Proof.} Observe that $A \subseteq A \cup B$ so that $|A| \leq |A \cup B|$. Meanwhile, subadditivity yields $|A \cup B| \leq |A| + |B| = |A|$ so that $|A| = |A \cup B|$. $\square$

\textbf{2} Suppose $A \subset \R$ and $t \in \R$. Let $tA = \{ta \mid a \in A\}$. Prove that $|tA| = |t||A|$. [Assume that $0 \cdot \infty$ is defined to be $0$.]

\emph{Proof.} The case wherein $t = 0$ is trivial; $tA = \{0\}$ or is an empty set. The case wherein $t < 0$ is virtually identical to when $t > 0$, so we omit it. Let $\{I_k\}$ be a countable cover of $A$ by open intervals. For any $a \in A$, we have $a \in I_k$ for at least one $k \in \Z^+$. It follows that $ta \in tI_k$ so that $tA \subseteq \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty tI_k$. Likewise, if $tA$ is covered by $\{tI_k\}$ then $A$ is covered by $\{I_k\}$. Thus $|tA| = \inf\left\{\sum_{k=1}^\infty tI_k \mid I_1, I_2, \ldots \text{ are open intervals and } A \subseteq \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty I_k\right\} = t|A| = |t||A|$. $\square$

\textbf{3} Prove that if $A, B \subset \R$ and $|A| < \infty$, then $|B - A| \geq |B| - |A|$.

\emph{Proof.} Observe that $B = (B - A) \cup (A \cap B)$. By subadditivity and order preservation we have $|B| - |A| = |(B - A) \cup (A \cap B)| - |A| \leq |B - A| + |A \cap B| - |A| = |B - A| - (|A| - |A \cap B|) \leq |B - A|$. $\square$

\textbf{4} Suppose $F$ is a subset of $\R$ with the property that every open cover of $F$ has a finite subcover. Prove that $F$ is closed and bounded.

\emph{Proof.} Obviously a set must be bounded in order to be compact. We now show that any non-closed set has an open set with no finite subcover. If a set $E$ is not closed, there is a limit point $c \in \R$ of $E$ such that $c \notin E$; particularly, given any radius $r > 0$, there exists a point $x \in E$ such that $0 < |x - c| < r$. Let $\{x_k\}$ be a sequence of points in $E$ such that $|x_{k+1} - c| \leq |x_k - c|$ for all $k \in \Z^+$ and $x_k \to x$ as $k \to \infty$. Let $\{I_k\}$ be a countable covering of $E$ by open intervals such that $x_i \in I_j$ if and only if $i = j$ and $x \notin \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty I_k$ (these criteria are possible because $\R$ is Hausdorff). $\{I_k\}$ is a ``minimal'' covering of $E$ in the sense that if any $I_k$ were removed, the sequence would no longer form a cover of $E$. As $\{I_k\}$ is an uncountable open cover, $E$ is not compact. $\square$

\textbf{5} Suppose $\mathcal{A}$ is a set of closed subsets of $\R$ such that $\bigcap_{F \in \mathcal{A}} F = \emptyset$. Prove that if $\mathcal{A}$ contains at least one bounded set, then there exist $n \in \Z^+$ and $F_1, \ldots, F_n \in \mathcal{A}$ such that $F_1 \cap \ldots \cap F_n = \emptyset$.

\emph{Proof.} Suppose $\mathcal{A}$ contains a bounded set $S$. Then
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
    S \cap \bigcap_{F \in \mathcal{A}} F &= \emptyset \\
    \implies S \subseteq \overline{\bigcap_{F \in \mathcal{A}} F} &= \bigcup_{F \in \mathcal{A}} \overline{F}.
\end{split}
\end{align}
By Heine-Borel theorem, $S$ is compact. Using this result, and because $\{\overline{F}\}_{F \in \mathcal{A}}$ is an open cover of $S$, there exists a finite subcover $\{\overline{F_k}\}_{k=2}^n$ of $S$. Hence
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
    S \subseteq \bigcup_{k=2}^n \overline{F_k} &= \overline{\bigcap_{k=2}^n F_k} \\
    \implies S \cap \bigcap_{k=2}^n F_k &= \emptyset.
\end{split}
\end{align}
Letting $F_1 = S$, we have attained the desired result. $\square$

\textbf{6} Prove that if $a, b \in \R$ and $a < b$, then $|(a, b)| = |[a, b)| = |(a, b]| = b - a$.

\emph{Proof.} Let $\varepsilon > 0$ satisfy $2\varepsilon \leq b - a$ but otherwise be chosen arbitrarily. Note that by the order preservation of outer measure we have $b - a - 2\varepsilon = |[a + \varepsilon, b - \varepsilon]| \leq |I| \leq |[a, b]| = b - a$ for $I = (a, b), I = [a, b),$ and $I = (a, b]$. Concisely, we have $b - a - 2\varepsilon \leq |I| \leq b - a$. Since $\varepsilon$ may be arbitrarily small, we may take the limit: $\displaystyle \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0^+} b - a - 2\varepsilon \leq \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0^+} |I| \leq \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0^+} b - a$. Thus $b - a \leq |I| \leq b - a$ so that $|I| = b - a$. $\square$

\textbf{7} Suppose $a, b, c, d$ are real numbers with $a < b$ and $c < d$. Prove that $|(a, b) \cup (c, d)| = (b - a) + (d - c)$ if and only if $(a, b) \cap (c, d) = \emptyset$.

\emph{Proof.} By subadditivity we know that $|(a, b) \cup (c, d)| \leq (b - a) + (d - c)$.

$(\impliedby)$ Suppose that $(a, b) \cap (c, d) = \emptyset$. Then
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
    |(a, b) \cap (c, d)| &= \inf\left\{\left.\sum_{k=1}^\infty I_k \right| I_1, I_2, \ldots \text{ are open intervals and } (a, b) \cap (c, d) \subseteq \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty I_k\right\} \\ \ \\
    &\geq \inf\left\{\left.\sum_{k=1}^\infty I_k \right| \ldots \text{and } (a, b) \subseteq \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty I_k\right\} + \inf\left\{\left.\sum_{k=1}^\infty I_k \right| \ldots \text{and } (c, d) \subseteq \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty I_k\right\} \\ \ \\
    &= |(a, b)| + |(c, d)| = (b - a) + (d - c).
\end{split}
\end{align}

$(\implies)$ On the other hand, suppose that $(a, b) \cap (c, d) = (c, b) \neq \emptyset$. Then $(a, b) \cup (c, d) = (a, d)$ so that $|(a, b) \cup (c, d)| = d - a < (d - a) + (b - c) = (b - a) + (d - c)$. $\square$

\textbf{8} Prove that if $A \subset \R$ and $t > 0$, then $|A| = |A \cap (-t, t)| + |A \cap (\R - (-t, t))|$.

\emph{Proof.} 

\textbf{9} Prove that $|A| = \lim_{t \to \infty} |A \cap (-t, t)|$ for all $A \subset \R$.

\textbf{10} Prove that $|[0, 1] - \Q| = 1$.

\textbf{11} Prove that if $I_1, I_2, \ldots$ is a disjoint sequence of open intervals, then $\left|\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty I_k\right| = \sum_{k=1}^\infty m(I_k)$.

\textbf{12} Suppose $r_1, r_2, \ldots$ is a sequence that contains every rational number. Let $F = \R - \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty \left(r_k - \frac{1}{2^k}, r_k + \frac{1}{2^k}\right)$.

(a) Show that $F$ is a closed subset of $\R$.

(b) Prove that if $I$ is an interval contained in $F$, then $I$ contains at most one element.

(c) Prove that $|F| = \infty$.

\textbf{13} Suppose $\varepsilon > 0$. Prove that there exists a subset $F$ of $[0, 1]$ such that $F$ is closed, every element of $F$ is an irrational number, and $|F| > 1 - \varepsilon$.
